These are my solutions to the [2023 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) puzzles. I'm attempting to solve them as they come out, along with a small group of friends. I'll also be writing my impressions of each puzzle.

# Puzzle 1

Part 1 was not too bad. I found my code golf instincts kicking in, which is why my solution is structured the way it is. Part 2 was unexpectedly evil. It tripped up a lot of my friends. I found myself getting sucked into a trap where I thought I had failed to solve the problem, but actually I had made a typo when entering my solution. Whoops!

# Puzzle 2

This one was harder to understand than to solve. Part 1 was straightforward. On Part 2 I was tripped up by my dyslexia (did a min instead of a max), but otherwise it was straightforward too. When I saw the flavor text about "bags with colored cubes" I recognized the phrasing from some much harder mathematical problems, and thought I was in for something much harder.

(Historical note: I've done a dozen or two puzzles before now, but always a la carte. I've never actually sat there waiting for the timer to count down until this time.)

# Puzzle 3

I actually placed sort of high on the leaderboard this time. Probably because this puzzle is unusual compared to other AOC puzzles, and so folks with extensive libraries of AOC-tailored code are at a disadvantage. My result was also not entirely unmaintainable, although it is really not structured well for testing, and... ugh, that O(nÂ²) bit, I am not proud of.
